The code for Decision Tree was developed in Python 3.8. and is being ran on the 'restautant.csv' file provided.
I used PyCharm IDE for developing the code.
The code can also be executed on a terminal by navigating to the directory containing the files descTree.py, DecTreeClass.py and restaurant.csv. You can use the following command to run the file: py filename.py, in this case py descTree.py
